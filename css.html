    <h2>What is CSS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strike>CSS is not necessary</strike>
            <span>CSS Saves a lot of work</span> "It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once"
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="Itaic">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>

   <h1 class="head">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h1>
   <ul class="main">
    <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
    <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 
        however, in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles, 
        because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>    
   </ul>
     <br>
     <br>
   <h3>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.
    ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly 
    to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="box1">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.
         Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p class="box1">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. 
        Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
